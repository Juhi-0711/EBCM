Description: Interface to 'TensorFlow' <https://www.tensorflow.org/>,
    an open source software library for numerical computation using
    data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical
    operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional
    data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible
    architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more 'CPUs'
    or 'GPUs' in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single
    'API'. 'TensorFlow' was originally developed by researchers and
    engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine
    Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting
    machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system
    is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other
    domains as well.
